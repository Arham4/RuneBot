<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OMgVAM6.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></img></p>

## What is it?
RuneBot is a Discord bot that aims to be an emulation of RuneScape, much like the concept behind [Pok√©bot](https://github.com/Wonder-Toast/Pokebot).

### [Click here to add the bot to your Discord!](https://tinyurl.com/AddRuneBot)

## Setup
You are required to have a PostgreSQL database with a `players` table. The structure for the `players` table is as follows:
```
CREATE TABLE players (
	discord_id text NULL,
	total_level int4 NULL,
	total_exp int4 NULL,
	levels int4[] NULL,
	experiences int4[] NULL,
	item_ids int4[] NULL,
	item_counts int4[] NULL
)
```
A config.yaml file must be made in the source root. The format for the YAML file is as follows:
```
messageCooldown: SECONDS
jdbc:
  url: "jdbc:postgresql://ADDRESS:PORT(typically 5432)/DB_NAME"
  driver: "org.postgresql.Driver"
  username: "DB_USERNAME"
  password: "DB_PASSWORD"
discord:
  token: "TOKEN AS PER DISCORDAPP.COM"
```
Next, locate the pom.xml file and find the following:
```
                    <jdbc>
                        <driver>org.postgresql.Driver</driver>
                        <url>jdbc:postgresql://ADDRESS:PORT(typically 5432)/DB_NAME</url>
                        <user>DB_USERNAME</user>
                        <password>DB_PASSWORD</password>
                    </jdbc>
```
Replace the info as done in the config.yaml.

Kotlin must be installed and configured on your computer. After all of that, use the following command to run the bot (if you choose to use command line/terminal):
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gmail.arhamjsiddiqui.runebot.RuneBot"
```
Before running the bot, and if not compiled before, build the project using the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```

## Features
- Creation of a character, made by using any command. Your character is linked to your discord account.
- A highscore system (including the ability to toggle from guild-view to global-view)!
```
r.rank [Optional: "global"] [Optional: SKILL] [Optional: @USER] - gets the rank of a player in that certain skill or total level.
r.highscore | r.ranks [Optional: "global"] [Optional: SKILL] - gets the top 10 players for a certain skill or total level.
```
- An items system, including a command to check items you currently own (and the ability to check other players' too!).
```
r.items [Optional: @USER]
```
- Training of skills, with acquiring items that you have the requirements for while doing so.
```
r.train SKILL
```
The formula for EXP is the following:
```
A random number from 
((15 * SKILL_LEVEL) 
to 
((a 1% possibility of (15 * SKILL_LEVEL) to the power of 1.5) 
    OR ((15 * SKILL_LEVEL) to the power of 1.2))).
```
This includes the ability to view those skills too (with the perk of it being a cool generated image!) (and the added benefit of checking other players' too!):
```
r.skills [Optional: @USER]
```
